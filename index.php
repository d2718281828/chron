<h1>About Party Time</h1>
<h2>What is a chron</h2>
<p>We needed a unit of time which is nothing to do with the Earth - as mankind leaps out to the stars,
the parochial orbital period of the third rock orbiting a G class star in the galactic suburbs will become less and less relevant.
We chose 100 million seconds. We needed a name for it. We chose <em>chron</em> (from the Greek word for time).</p>
<p>Plus, it's kinda cool to see the numbers ratcheting up and all those zeroes appearing at once.</p>
<h2>This site is nothing to do with astrology</h2>
<p>Note that the comments on this site are based on astronomical facts about the orbits of the planets, not about any astrological 
associations, which have no credible influence on the destinies of individual people.</p>

<p>Saturnian birthdays donâ€™t come round that often, which makes this one is pretty special.</p>
<p>How should you celebrate? Saturn was a Roman god with quite a few responsibilities, including wealth, plenty, 
agriculture and renewal. He is the only Roman deity to have a day of the week named after him. 
His festival in Roman times, the Saturnalia, is widely assumed to have been taken over by the early Christians as 
the basis for the Christmas festivities.</p>
<p>There are a lot of mythological associations for Saturn which you can use to inspire your celebration. 
You can read more about the mythological associations of 
Saturn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_(mythology)">on Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>Astronomically, of course, the planet Saturn has a spectacular set of rings: 
it isn't the only planet to have a ring system but it is by far the biggest and most spectacular.</p>
<p>We have taken information about the orbit of Saturn 
from <a href="https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/saturnfact.html">NASA</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A note about accuracy</strong>: although, for fun, on this site we calculate your age in 
Saturn years to 9 decimal places, the figure we have for the length of the year is only accurate to one hundredth 
of a day (about quarter of an hour), 
so the figure for your age in Saturn years is only actually accurate to 6 decimal places.</p>
